# MLP Implemented in VHDL

## Abstract
Our objective is to implement a standard MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) structure in hardware using VHDL. We achieve this by designing three main parts of the MLP. \
The three parts are as follow:

- Input layer
- Neurons which construct our hidden layer
- Output layer and activation function

The above three parts are what make up a standard MLP structure.

## Inference VS Learning
There are two approaches that can be taken. \
The first approach is to use pretrained weights which will allow us to perform inference steps by feeding a stream of data to our network. \
The second approach is to use a gradient descent algorithm to perform a learning step.
